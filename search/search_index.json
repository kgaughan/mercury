As it pulls out entries, it performs a heapify operation using the publication date of the topmost item in each feed as the key. This guarantees that the first feed is always the one with the most recent entry while doing the least amount of processing. It then takes the topmost item in that feed, increments its counter, and starts the cycle again. This effectively does a partial heapsort of the total collection of feed items.</p> <p>One weakness with the current implementaton is that it doesn't yet deal with feeds that don't sort their items in reverse chronological order. Two options would be to sort feeds as they're pulled down or to heapify the entries similarly to what's done with the feeds themselves. This latter approach is probably the best one to take if there are many feeds with many items. For feeds that are already sorted, the heap property should already hold, so the impact for them would be negligible.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/#cache-directory","title":"Cache directory","text":"<p>The cache directory stores the cache manifest in <code>manifest.json</code>, and cached copies of feeds serialised as JSON files.</p> <p>The manifest file consists of a map of feed URLs to metadata, including the UUID used for the cache filename, the last modified date, and the entity tag, both of which are used to make conditional GET requests against the target feed to minimise Mercury's bandwidth impact.</p>"},{"location":"configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>The top-level configuration fields are:</p> Name Type Description Default name string The name of your planet \"Planet\" url string The base URL of your planet \"\" owner string Your name \"\" email string Your email \"\" feed_id string Unique ID to use for the Atom feed \"\" cache string The path, relative to mercury.toml of the feed cache \"./cache\" generate_feed boolean Should a feed be generated? true timeout duration How long to wait when fetching a feed - theme string The path, relative to mercury.toml of the theme to use use default theme output string The path, relative to mercury.toml to which mercury should write the files it generates \"./output\" items number The number of items to include per page 10 max_pages number The maximum number of pages to generate 5 <p>Note that the <code>theme</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>cache</code> paths are assumed to be relative to the directory in which the configuration file is found, not the current working directory.
