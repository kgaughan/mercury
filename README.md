<img src="docs/mercury.png" align="right">_Mercury_ is intended a replacement for Sam Ruby's [Planet Venus](https://github.com/rubys/venus/).

A _planet_ is a kind of feed aggregator. It takes a list of newsfeeds (Atom, RSS, &c.), splices them together, and spits a set of HTML pages and/or a feed.

For details, please [see the documentation](docs/index.md).

If you're using Planet Mercury for any sites, I'd be happy to list them.
